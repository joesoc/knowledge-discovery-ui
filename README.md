# Knowledge Discovery UI

A sleek and intuitive **Angular**-based interface for interacting with OpenText Knowledge Discovery (IDOL), built for enterprise-level unstructured data search and analysis. This application showcases advanced Q&A capabilities, topic mining, secure document access, and contextual insights drawn from official reports and internal documents.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Natural Language Q&A
- Ask questions in plain English and get precise answers extracted from large collections of enterprise documents.
- Example: "Tell me about waste and fraud in the Singapore government" returns a clear summary backed by official audit sources.

### 🧠 Topic Detection and Analytics
- Identifies and ranks **frequent topics** across a document set.

- Displays how many documents and occurrences are linked to each topic (e.g., “Audit of Government Ministries”, “Use of Public Resources”).

### 🧾 Source Traceability
- All answers link directly to their **source documents**, ensuring transparency and auditability.
- Supports deep diving into PDFs and government reports with contextually extracted highlights.

### 🔐 Mapped Security Integration
- Implements IDOL's **mapped ACL security**, allowing users to access only the documents permitted by their roles.
- Supports connectors like SharePoint, Exchange, and File System for real-time ACL recognition.

### 📊 Intelligent Disambiguation
- Distinguishes similar-sounding entities or team names using contextual awareness.
- Example: Accurately determines that "Robotics team" attended a conference instead of the "Analytics team."
